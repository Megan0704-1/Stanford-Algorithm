The protocol most widely used to send data across individual links is Ethernet.

- **Protocol**: In the context of computer networks, a protocol is a set of rules or standards that define how data is transmitted and received over a network. Protocols ensure that devices on a network can communicate effectively, regardless of their underlying hardware and software differences.

- **Most widely used**: This phrase indicates that the subject (Ethernet, in this case) is the most common or popular choice among available options for a specific purpose. It suggests that Ethernet is the predominant standard for the task described.

- **To send data**: Refers to the process of transferring information from one device to another. In networking, sending data involves generating and transmitting data packets over a network to a destination device.

- **Across individual links**: This part of the sentence specifies the scope of the communication. Individual links refer to the direct connections between devices in a network. These can be wired connections (using cables) or wireless connections (using radio waves). The term emphasizes that the context is about communication over these single, direct connections, rather than through a more complex network structure.

- **Ethernet**: Ethernet is a family of networking technologies and protocols that are used for local area networks (LANs), metropolitan area networks (MANs), and wide area networks (WANs). Developed in the 1970s by Xerox Corporation, Ethernet has evolved to include higher bandwidth, improved media access control methods, and different physical media. It is the most common method of connecting devices in a wired LAN and involves specific standards for cable types and signal transmission.

Overall, the sentence highlights Ethernet's role as the primary technology for transmitting data over direct connections between devices within networks. Ethernet's widespread adoption is attributed to its reliability, standardization, and ability to support high-speed data transfers.
